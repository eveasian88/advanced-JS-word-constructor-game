# advanced-JS-word-constructor-game

This is a Node.js Command Line Interface (CLI) Word Guessing Game built using JavaScript object constructors. The index.js runs the actual game with a dependency on the constructor, Word.js, which also has a dependency on the Letter.js constructor. 


### The game starts with a random word selected from the word bank

- the words are displayed through the terminal with an underscore representing each letter


### The player is prompted for a number of eight guesses

- if the player guesses correctly, the letter is revealed
- if the player guesses incorrectly, failed attemps is reduced by one
- the player can only input one letter at a time
- the player can only guess a letter once


### When the player failed attempts reaches zero

- the game is over
- the game reloads a new word for player to guess


### When the player guesses the word correctly

- the player wins 
- the answer is displayed
- the player can choose to guess a new word
